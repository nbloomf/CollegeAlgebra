Let's start with a question.

\begin{question}
What is the area of a square with side length 2? \answer{4}
\begin{problem}
What is the area of a square with side length 3? \answer{9}
\end{problem}
\end{question}

This is getting tedious. But notice - our answers are following a pattern:

\begin{question}
What is the area of a square with side length $n$? $\answer{n^2}$
\hint{How did you find the answers to }
\end{question}
