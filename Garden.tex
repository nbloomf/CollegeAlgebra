\begin{abstract}
We try to design a garden with the largest possible area.
\end{abstract}

We have 100 meters of barbed wire fence, and want to enclose a garden in a rectangular area with one side bordered by a river.

\begin{exploration}
Click and drag point $X$ to see how different widths affect the area.

\begin{problem}
It appears that the largest possible area is about $\answer[tolerance=5]{1250}$
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
It appears that the largest area is obtained when $W = \answer[tolerance=1]{25}$
\end{problem}
